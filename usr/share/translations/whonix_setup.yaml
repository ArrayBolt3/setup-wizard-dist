            <p>ENG. The documentation available on Whonix.org is a crash course in anonymity, privacy, and security on the Internet.</p>
            Whonix is a technological means to anonymity, but staying anonymous is not just a technological problem.
            No tool is enough to keep you safe. Anonymity is a complex problem without an easy solution, and security is only as strong as
            its weakest link, often the user. The more you know, the safer you can be.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Whonix-Gateway!<br />
            <br />
            This is NOT a personal work station for your own private activities! So please do NOT use Whonix-Gateway for any purpose other than configuring Tor and Whonix.<br />
            <br />
            The more you learn about Whonix and anonymity, the safer you can become. Reading Whonix documentation is recommended.<br />
            <br />
            If your host has little RAM, you are advised to reduce Whonix-Gateway RAM to 256 MB. No graphical desktop environment will be started in that case. A Whonix-Gateway without graphical desktop environment works as good as one with, but it is not as convenient. If you want, you can start a graphical desktop environment by toggling how much RAM is available to Whonix-Gateway.<br />
