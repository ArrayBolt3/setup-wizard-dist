            <p>Welcome to Whonix-Gateway!<br />
            <br />
            This is NOT a personal work station for your own private activities! So please do NOT use Whonix-Gateway for any purpose other than configuring Tor and Whonix.<br />
            <br />
            The more you learn about Whonix and anonymity, the safer you can become. Reading Whonix documentation is recommended.<br />
            <br />
            If your host has little RAM, you are advised to reduce Whonix-Gateway RAM to 256 MB. No graphical desktop environment will be started in that case. A Whonix-Gateway without graphical desktop environment works as good as one with, but it is not as convenient. If you want, you can start a graphical desktop environment by toggling how much RAM is available to Whonix-Gateway.<br />
