            <p><b>Important Information About This Operating System (OS) Part 1/2</b></p>
            <p>Please do NOT continue unless you understand everything!</p>
            <p>This is not the usual blah blah blah but fact. This OS is a research project.
            This OS is free of charge. This OS is a derivative of Debian GNU/Linux.
            This OS is produced independently of, with no guarantee from, The Tor Project.
            This OS is created by volunteers in their spare time. This OS was created by
            self-taught hobbyists in their spare time, without the backing of any particular
            formal certification or training. Although This OS attempts to be as usable as
            possible, there are many ways in which it fails. This OS is in English. Do not
            use This OS without excellent knowledge of the English language.
            Misunderstandings have consequences. This OS is based on other software,
            including GNU/Linux, Debian, and virtualization. Do not rely on
            This OS without working knowledge of these technologies.</p>

        disclaimer_2_kicksecure:
            <p>The documentation available on Kicksecure.com is a crash course in anonymity, privacy, and security on the Internet. Kicksecure is a technological means to security, but staying secure is not just a technological problem. No tool is enough to keep you safe. Security is a complex problem without an easy solution, and security is only as strong as its weakest link, often the user. The more you know, the safer you can be.</p>

        disclaimer_2_whonix:
            <p>The documentation available on Whonix.org is a crash course in anonymity, privacy, and security on the Internet. Whonix is a technological means to anonymity, but staying anonymous is not just a technological problem. No tool is enough to keep you safe. Anonymity is a complex problem without an easy solution, and security is only as strong as its weakest link, often the user. The more you know, the safer you can be.</p>

            <p>Welcome to This OS-Gateway!<br />
            <br />
            This is NOT a personal work station for your own private activities! So please do NOT use This OS-Gateway for any purpose other than configuring Tor and This OS.<br />
            <br />
            The more you learn about This OS and anonymity, the safer you can become. Reading This OS documentation is recommended.<br />
            <br />
            If your host has little RAM, you are advised to reduce This OS-Gateway RAM to 256 MB. No graphical desktop environment will be started in that case. A This OS-Gateway without graphical desktop environment works as good as one with, but it is not as convenient. If you want, you can start a graphical desktop environment by toggling how much RAM is available to This OS-Gateway.<br />
